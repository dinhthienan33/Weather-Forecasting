# Weather-Forecasting
This is my implementation about forecasting using FB Prophet

This repo contains data, baseline(ipynb file), I saved the model so you can change the data and apply the model without run whole the code again
Use this to load the model:

**with open("model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pc.load(f)**
